## Understanding State

In React, **state** is a built-in feature that allows components to manage and track data that can change over time. State is what makes React components dynamic and interactive.

### Key Concepts:

- **useState Hook**: The `useState` hook is a function that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value.

  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  ```

  - `count`: The current state value.
  - `setCount`: A function to update the state.

- **Updating State**: When the state is updated using the `setCount` function, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state.

- **Re-rendering**: React automatically re-renders the component whenever the state changes, ensuring that the UI is always in sync with the underlying data.
